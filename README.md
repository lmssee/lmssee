## Hi there 👋

long long a go, when  i'm a child.
At that time, I was still in school and my English class was terrible.
In class, the foreign language teacher asked me to go to the podium to write English words.
and I wrote "This is mi" .
My classmates laughed uncontrollably when they saw it,
and then they called me 'is mi'
...
...
Time flies so fast, the little boy who didn't work hard grew up and became a useless waste. 
Now, I have two hobbies: eating 🍔🍱🍢🍭 and sleeping. especially , eating in my dream that I usually cannot afford.
